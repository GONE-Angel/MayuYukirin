## Installation instruction
### Adding the repository to your bot
Before you can install any of my cogs, you must add this repository to your bot. Add it by issuing the following command  
`[p]repo add mayukirin https://github.com/skeith/mayuyukirin`

`[p]` is your bot prefix and `mayukirin` is the name of the repository, you can change it to anything you want. For example, you find `mayukirin` is too long as repository name to be added to your bot (since you will be typing this name when you install a cog later) and you want to shorten it to `yuki`. Then the command become  
`[p]repo add yuki https://github.com/skeith/mayuyukirin`

*For consistency of this README, I will use `mayukirin` when refering to my repository.*  
&nbsp;

### Listing available cogs
Once you added the repository, you should be able to list available cogs by issuing  
`[p]cog list mayukirin`

Once you did that, the bot will list names of available cogs from my repository.  
&nbsp;

### Installing a cog
Pick one cog name of the available cog list from above command. For this example, let say you want to install `avatar` cog. Issue this command to install it  
`[p]cog install mayukirin avatar`  

The cog installation will be started. Any requirements will be automatically installed.

Once installation done (the bot will tell you when the installation is finished and sucessful) you can load the cog with this command  
`[p]load avatar`
